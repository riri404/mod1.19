# mod1.19

Zircon Mod is a Minecraft mod that adds new zircon items and blocks to the game. With this mod, players can craft zircon ingots, zircon blocks, . The mod is designed to run on version 1.19 of Minecraft. The project can be found on the master branch.


Features

Zircon Ingot: A new item that can be crafted from zircon ore.

Zircon Block: A decorative block that can be crafted from nine zircon ingots.


Issues

While the mod runs perfectly all of the time, there is a known issue with the image rendering on the zircon block. Sometimes the image of the zircon block appears untextured in the inventory, but it looks fine once block is placed down. I am working on debugging this issue and hope to release a fix soon.
